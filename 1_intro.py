# Python basics
# 
# Designed to be more human readable
# Indentation is key
#
# Functions must be defined and can be "called" with or without arguments/parameters depending on how the function is written
# Strings, integers and booleans?

    print("Hello world")


hello_world()


# def hello_name(name):
