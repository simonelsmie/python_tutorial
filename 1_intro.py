# Python basics
# 
# Designed to be more human readable
# Indentation is key
#
# Functions must be defined and can be "called" with or without arguments/parameters depending on how the function is written
# Strings, integers and booleans?


def hello_world():
    print("Hello world")


hello_world()


def hello_name(name):
    print("Hello " + name)

# hello_name("Simon")





# print vs. return
def print_four():
    print(4)


# print_four()

def print_five():
    return "This is a test banana"

# print(print_five())

banana = print_five()
# print(banana)



# Variables
# Set using =
# From right to left

name = "Andy"
# print(name)
