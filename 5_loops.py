# Iteration using for and while loops
# Counters

# While loops
# This type of loop will continue indefinitely while a condition is true

counter = 0

while (counter < 5):
    # print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1


# Guessing game


# Breaking out of while loops


# For loops only iterate for the length of the list
numbers  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    

# How would we total all the numbers in numbers?
